## Description

In my Btech final year project  my team worked on a thesis on an AI Based Traffic management system(TrafficAI) on the basis of an idea to automate the traffic system . Our goal was to perform research on whether it is possible to automate the traffic system, advantages and disadvantages  of having it , how it should be built , is it cost feasible .
We have used the YOLO model and opencvâ€™s DarkNet algo to detect , differentiate the transport objects separately .


## Tech Stack

Python, Jupyter Notebook, Computer Vision, OpenCV, MoviePy

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/LordSomen/Traffic-Analysis my_project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  # make sure to install python
  # numpy
  # pandas
  # opencv
```
install the yolov3 model from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16c9eWU_-ZktkjPH5RrEmXz1gRt_sxxYE?usp=sharing).

running the code in local

```bash
  # for analyzing traffic in image file
  python yolo.py -i [local_path_to_image_file] -y [local_path_to_yolov3_model]

  # for analyzing traffic in video file
  python yolo.py -i [local_path_to_video_file] -y [local_path_to_yolov3_model]
```


## Lessons Learned

We have Learned how to use yolov3 model to detect different objects in any digital picture or videofeed.

one of the main challenges is to optimize our model to detect diffrent traffic objects in a crowd, in that scenario we have to tune the model a bit and run it couple of times to understand how to detect different as much possible
